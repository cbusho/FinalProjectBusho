Final Project- Colin Busho ECE383

-General Description
	The goal of the project is to interface with the CAN Bus of my 2009 Chevrolet 
	Cobalt. I will read in the various signals and learn how the bus sends signals to
	control the electronics of the car. I will then spoof the signals to control the
	features of the car myself. This will all be done using GPIO on the FPGA to control
	features such as the windows and locks.
  
-Functionalities
	-Required
		This will be reading in the signals sent out from the CAN Bus in a
		meaningful way (not just a stream of bits). 
	-B Functionality
		This will be controlling simple switch features such as the locks (locked
		or unlocked) or the windows (up or down).
	-A Functionality
		This will be controlling a monitor with a range of values (RPMs or 
		speedometer).


-Schedule
	-Mon 28 April- Required Functionality
	-Fri 2 May- B Functionality
	-Tues 6 May- A Functionality 

-Initial Design
	Use knowledge of structure of CAN message to program FPGA to accept message bits.

-Preparation
	I am prepared to begin work.
